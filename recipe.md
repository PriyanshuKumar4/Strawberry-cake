1. To make the strawberry reduction, add the strawberries to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth. You  should have about 1 1/2 cups of puree.

2. Add the puree to a medium sized saucepan and cook over medium heat. Allow the mixture to come to a slow boil, stirring consistently to keep it from burning, until it has thickened and reduced to 3/4 cup, about 20-25 minutes. To measure, pour the puree into a measuring cup. If it’s more than 3/4 cup, add it back to the pan and continue cooking.

3. When the puree has thickened and reduced, pour into a large measuring cup and allow to cool to at least room temperature. This strawberry mixture can be made ahead, if you like, and stored in the fridge.

4. Preheat oven to 350°F (176°C) and prepare three 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper in the bottom and baking spray on the sides.

5. Combine the strawberry reduction, sour cream, milk, eggs and vanilla extract in a large bowl, then separate about 1 cup of the mixture into another bowl or measuring cup. About 1 1/2 cups should remain in the other bowl. Set both aside.

6. In a large mixer bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

7. With the mixer on the lowest speed, add the butter about a tablespoon at a time, allowing it to incorporate before adding the next tablespoon. As you add more butter, the mixture will start to clump together a bit a should end up resembling wet sand.

8. Add the larger of the reserved egg mixture (about 1 1/2 cups) to the dry ingredients/butter mixture. Stir on the lowest speed until it’s incorporated, then scrape down the sides of the bowl.

9. Increase the speed to medium high and beat until light and fluffy, about 45 seconds to one minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.

10. Turn the speed down to low and slowly add the remaining egg mixture in a slow stream until incorporated.

11. Scrape the sides of the bowl, then turn speed back up to medium high and mix until well combined, about 10-15 seconds.

13. Divide the batter evenly between the three cake pans and bake 24-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs.

14. Remove cakes from the oven and allow to cool for 2-3 minutes, then remove to cooling rack to cool completely.

15. To make the frosting, add the freeze dried strawberries to a food processor and grind into a powder. It should give you a little more than half a cup of strawberry powder.

16. In a large mixer bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter together until smooth.

17. Slowly add half of the powdered sugar and the vanilla extract and mix until smooth.

18. Slowly add remaining powdered sugar and strawberry powder and mix until smooth. Add some salt, to taste. Set aside.

19. To put the cake together, use a large serrated knife to remove the domes from the top of the cakes so that they’re flat.
 if needed. Place the first cake on a serving plate or a cardboard cake round.

20. Add about 1 cup of frosting to the top of the cake layer and spread evenly. Add about half of the chopped strawberries and press into the frosting.

21. Add the second layer of cake, another cup of frosting and the remaining chopped strawberries.

22. Top the cake with the remaining layer and frost the cake with the remaining frosting.

23. Pipe the shell border around the top and bottom of the cake. I used a large closed star tip for the top – Ateco 847. For the border around the bottom of the cake, I used Wilton tip 22.

24. Add a few strawberries on top for decoration and refrigerate until ready to serve. Cake is best when stored well covered and eaten within 3-4 days.
